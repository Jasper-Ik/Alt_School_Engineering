This project was inspired first by the zrui team and then with motivation form tech friends in Alt school.
To recreate the google homepage of our windows Pc.

In designing this page i got a bit creative by first centering the page using grid, then declaring the min and max width of the page.
Using flexbox i was able to center the content of the page and give it the layout it has.


The image below are the final outcome of the design.
